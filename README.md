# RRT-Path-Finding-Algorithm 

Developed alongside @AditJainn
This is an algorithm that applies an RRT-based approach to get a 'robot' to find a way from a start point to finish point in a sophisticated jpeg map.
We then applied this to drive a robot in the Gazebo simulator using ROS2. Application of the algorithm can be found in AditJainn's Github.

Further updates for optimization to follow.
