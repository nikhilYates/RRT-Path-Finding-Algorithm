# RRT-Path-Finding-Algorithm 

Developed alongside @AditJainn
This is an algorithm that applies an RRT-based approach to get a 'robot' to find a way from a start point to finish point in a sophisticated jpeg map.
We then applied this to drive a robot in the Gazebo simulator using ROS2. Application of the algorithm can be found in AditJainn's Github.

FOR READABILITY:
1. readImage.py is the algorithm
2. rotatedDILATED is a DILATED jpeg of our original map
3. chonker is the output (with path) of the program
   a. the green dot represents the starting point and the tourqouise point represents the end goal
   b. the path from start to goal is represented with a red line


Further updates for optimization to follow.
